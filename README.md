# Car Detection in Traffic Images Project

This project aims to detect cars in traffic images using PyTorch, matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV (cv2). The detection model is implemented using a deep learning approach and trained on a dataset of traffic images.

## Installation

To run the project, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:
```bash
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Open the project in your preferred Python environment.
4. Run the car detection code on your desired traffic images.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the car detection model is not included in this repository. Please ensure you have your own dataset of traffic images and annotations for training and testing the model.

## Model Training

The car detection model was trained using PyTorch and a custom architecture based on a suitable pre-trained model. The training scripts and model architecture details are available in the repository.

## Results

The project achieves accurate car detection in various traffic scenarios. The results can be visualized using the provided visualization code using matplotlib and OpenCV.
